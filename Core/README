How to use these files
----------------------

### Installation

1. Verify that you have premake4 installed. See extra/README for more details.
2. Run premake4 --with-all [plat] where plat is the desired platform, and "--with-all" active every "--with" debugging options. We also recommend the â€”with-cpp11 option to activate C++11 features, which are great. 
3. Use the generated build files to build the library.

This process will generate the Core lirary, without any plugins or examples.
For help on premake4 script options, type "premake4 --help".

### Cleaning

Just run 'premake4 clean' to clean every unused files. You will have to re-run the initial premake4
script to get the makefiles again.
'html' folder created by Doxygen isn' destroyed during cleaning, so you'll have to remove it manually.

### Working on the sources

You can work on the source simply by creating the IDE's files you like ( as 'premake4 codeblocks' for
example ) and then work on the source. Think to clean your folder before any push.

### Documentation

You can build the doc if you have doxygen. Simply run doxygen in this directory. Documentation will output
by default in the 'html' directory. 
Then open the 'index.html' file in the 'html' directory with your favorite browser.

### Dependancies 

You must have 'pthread' if you want multithreading features. This feature is enabled by default, but you still
can disable it with option '--no-thread'in premake4.
