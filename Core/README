How to use these files
----------------------

### Installation

1. Verify that you have premake4 installed. See extra/README for more details.
2. Run premake4 [plat] where plat is the desired platform.
3. Use the generated build files to build the library.

This process will generate the Core lirary, without any plugins or examples.

### Cleaning

Just run 'premake4 clean' to clean every unused files. You will have to re-run the initial premake4
script to get the makefiles again.

### Working on the sources

You can work on the source simply by creating the IDE's files you like ( as 'premake4 codeblocks' for
example ) and then work on the source. Think to run 'premake4 clean' before any push.

### Documentation

You can build the doc if you have doxygen. Simply run doxygen in this directory. Documentation will output
by default in the 'html' directory. 
Then open the 'index.html' file in the 'html' directory with your favorite browser.
